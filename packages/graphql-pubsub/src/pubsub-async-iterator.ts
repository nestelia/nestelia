/**
 * Async iterator for GraphQL subscriptions backed by a {@link PubSubEngine}.
 *
 * Implements the `AsyncIterator` / `AsyncIterable` protocols so it can be
 * used directly in GraphQL resolvers:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * yield* pubsub.asyncIterator<MyEvent>("MY_EVENT");
 * ```
 *
 * Internally it maintains two queues:
 * - **pullQueue** – pending `next()` promises waiting for a message.
 * - **pushQueue** – messages that arrived before `next()` was called.
 *
 * To prevent unbounded memory growth the push-queue is capped at
 * {@link MAX_QUEUE_SIZE}; oldest entries are dropped when the limit is
 * exceeded (similar to a lossy channel).
